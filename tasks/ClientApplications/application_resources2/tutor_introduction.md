# Tutor Introduction
I'm Jake, a recent MEng graduate from the University of Oxford. I have extensive experience teaching Maths and Physical Sciences at the IB level, achieving a score of 44 in 2018 with 7s in both subjects. My passion lies in using Maths and Physics creatively and exploring non-traditional mathematical topics. I am committed to helping students excel in the GCSE, MYP, IB, A Levels, and Oxbridge applications.

I completed the IB at the British International School of Houston in 2018, scoring 44 with 7s in all my HL and SL subjects. Growing up in multiple countries—such as the US, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Malaysia, and the UK—has given me a unique background. Though I have a British accent, passport, and parents, I sometimes call myself "Texan," which tends to confuse people.

At school, I enjoyed self-teaching and developed ways to create clear explanations and diagrams for memorizing key information and solving problems. I incorporate these techniques into my tutoring sessions and aim to share what I’ve learned from my own IB journey.

During my studies at Oxford, I specialized in Information, Software, and Control, focusing on areas such as systems control, coding, data science, machine learning, probability, and statistics. This is my favorite engineering field as it has wide-ranging applications and allows for innovative data and software solutions.

I also have a deep interest in music—playing piano and guitar and even composing music in my younger years. For my 4th-year project, I built software to analyze music and compare song similarities. While Maths and Physics are my academic strengths, I consider myself a generalist with interests that go beyond technical subjects. I find this beneficial in tutoring, as it helps me relate to students who may have a wider range of interests and not a natural affinity for Maths or Physics. For my 4th year project I worked on building software to analyse music and compare how different songs are similar. Engineering and the IB have given me a very strong foundation in Maths and Physics, but overall I consider myself a generalist, and am interested in so many things beyond just Maths, Physics and Engineering. I find this to be a strength as a tutor, because I know that lots of people aren't big fans of Maths or Physics or just have wider interests in general, and I really enjoy helping students gain a passion in maths and physics, and to begin to enjoy finding ways to apply these concepts to real life scenarios in areas that go beyond just technical stuff.

I find that projects allow me to do this kind of thing, and I have lots of experience with developing and writing up maths and physics related projects, both in my degree and in the IB with my IAs. Maths and Physics IAs were one of my favourite aspects of the IBDP as they allowed me to explore maths and physics in the context of my wider and deeper interests, and I really enjoy helping students do the same with their IAs, achieving a great mark in the process. My biggest passion is using Maths and Physics for creating things, and exploring topics that might not seem "mathematical" at first. I haven't completely figured out what career I want to go into yet but anything that allows me to do that is on the list. Entrepreneurship is another interest of mine, and I study that as a component of my degree.

Overall, I am very eager to help students achieve their full potential and do well in the GCSE, the MYP, the IB and Oxbridge applications, as well as preparing them for their future studies and careers by building up their interest, intrigue and passion in the subjects.

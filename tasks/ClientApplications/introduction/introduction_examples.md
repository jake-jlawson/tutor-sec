# INTRODUCTION EXAMPLES

## Example 1:
### Job: IB Mathematics Applications and Interpretations HL summer support
Hi, I’m Jake and I would be very happy to support you over the summer with Maths AI HL. I’ve just graduated from Oxford with a degree in Engineering so I have a strong background in Mathematics as well as how it applies to real world applications. I also did the IB myself in 2018 and got a 7 in HL Maths, so I have been in your position before and know what it takes to get the top marks. One of my passions is to show students how Maths can be applied to many different topics and real life scenarios - key skills and understanding necessary for getting the top marks in IB AI HL. 

## Example 2:
### Job: ESAT & Admissions Support for Cambridge and Imperial
I’d be very happy to support this student with the ESAT and anything further related to their Engineering university applications (Cambridge and Imperial). I have just graduated with an Engineering degree from Oxford, and took the ENGAA (the test which the ESAT is based on) myself in 2018. Since then, I have supported over 10 students with the ESAT and university applications, and have a strong background in the test and what it requires.

## Example 3:
### Job: ESAT Tutoring
I’d be very happy to support this student with the ESAT. I have just graduated with an Engineering degree from Oxford, and took the ENGAA (the test which the ESAT is based on) myself in 2018. Since then, I have supported over 10 students with the ESAT and university applications, and have a strong background in the test and what it requires.

## Example 4:
### Job: Cambridge Interview Preparation
I would be very happy to support this student. I have recently graduated from Oxford with a degree in Engineering and have 3 years of tutoring experience, including running courses and practice interviews for numerous Engineering Oxbridge applicants. I have applied to both Cambridge and Oxford for Engineering myself, and have a strong background in the interviews, how to approach them, and what the admissions tutors look for.

## Example 5:
### Job: Cambridge Physics Interview Preparation
My name is Jake and I am a recent Oxford Engineering graduate and tutor with 3 years of experience. I am very interested in supporting this student with their preparation for the Cambridge Physics Interview. I have a strong background in Physics from my degree and school studies. Although I did not apply for Physics, the physics interviews are very similar to the engineering interviews so I have a good idea of what the interviewers look for, and I have supported many students with Oxbridge interviews, including Physics interviews, achieving a success rate of 66% (compared to the university average of 20%).

## Example 6:
### Job: IB Mathematics Applications and Interpretations SL
Hi, I'm Jake and I would be interested in supporting you with your Maths AI SL course. I did the IB myself in 2018 with a 7 in HL Maths, so I have a strong familiarity with the IB and the IB Maths syllabus and how to succeed in it. I have successfully supported many SL students and I am experienced teaching students who maybe find Maths difficult, might not enjoy the subject, or just aren't interested in taking it further in the future. One of my passions is to help make Maths relatable and interesting, and simplify complex topics and concepts, and as a generalist, I really enjoy showing how Maths can be relevant and applicable to a huge range of different topics of interest and real life scenarios.

## Example 7:
### Job: IB Physics HL
I would be really interested supporting this student! I am a recent Oxford graduate with 3 years of tutoring experience, including tutoring many IB Physics HL students. I did the IB myself in 2018 and got a 7 in Physics HL so I have been in your position and can understand the pressures, difficulties and intricacies of the course. I am very familiar with the course and have a strong background in Physics from my degree and in teaching physics from my tutoring experience. 

## Example 8:
### Job: IB Mathematics Analysis and Approaches HL IA
I would be very interested and capable of supporting this student with their IA. I did the IB myself in 2018 with a score of 44 and a 7 in HL Maths. I wrote my IA on the mathematics of sound design in music production, and after lots of hard work got 19/20 in it. I found the IA a really interesting experience which allowed me to go into depth and apply Maths to one of my interests, and so I really love getting involved with IA students and helping them to have a similar experience. I have 3 years of tutoring experience, including supporting many students with their IAs, and through this have developed a sound method to guide students through the IA process from start to finish, or from whatever stage they are currently at in the process.

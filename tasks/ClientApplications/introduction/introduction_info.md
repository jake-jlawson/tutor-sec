# INTRODUCTION INFO

## Overview
My name is Jake.
I am from the UK, but have lived most of my life outside the UK attending international schools.
I am a recent graduate of the University of Oxford (2024) with a Masters degree in Engineering.
I am now working as a tutor for a year after graduating, to pass on my knowledge and experience to students, help them achieve their goals, and make Maths and Physics relatable, interesting, engaging and useful to students.
I have been working as a tutor for nearly 3 years and have lots of experience tutoring students of a variety of ages and backgrounds.

## Educational History
At Oxford I specialised in Information and Software Engineering, with additional courses on Entrepreneurship and Management, Control Systems, & Electrical/Electronic Engineering.
Before Oxford I completed the IB programme at the British International School of Houston, in Texas, and recieved an IB diploma with 44 points, including 7s in all my HL subjects (Maths, Physics, and Chemistry) and SL subjects (English Lang/Lit, Spanish B and Economics).
I have also lived in lots of other countries growing up, including the USA, Spain (Madrid), Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.
I took iGCSEs when I lived in Saudi Arabia, achieving A*s in all 11 subjects.

## Tutoring Experience
I have personal experience completing the following courses myself:
- GCSE/iGCSE Maths
- GCSE/iGCSE Further Maths
- GCSE/iGCSE Physics
- GCSE/iGCSE Chemistry
- GCSE/iGCSE Statistics
- IB Mathematics HL
- IB Mathematics Coursework (IAs)
- IB Physics HL
- IB Physics Coursework (IAs)
- Oxford and Cambridge Engineering Admissions (personal statements, admissions tests, interviews).
- ENGAA
- PAT
- Oxford Engineering Interviews.
- Imperial (IC) Engineering Admissions (EIE/EEE)

I have strong expertise and specialise in (from my own experience and my 3 years tutoring other students):
- IB Mathematics Applications and Interpretations HL
- IB Mathematics Analysis and Approaches HL
- IB Mathematics Applications and Interpretations SL
- IB Mathematics Analysis and Approaches SL
- IB Mathematics IAs
- IB Physics HL
- IB Physics SL
- IB Physics IAs
- IB Extended Essay (in Maths or Physics)
- Oxbridge Admissions Tests (ESAT Maths and Physics, PAT, ENGAA, etc.)
- Oxbridge Interviews (Engineering, Physics)
- Personal Statements (Engineering all types, Physics, Maths, any other quantitative STEM subject)
- Imperial (IC) Engineering Interviews (all engineering types but specialising in EIE/EEE)
- GCSE/iGCSE Maths
- GCSE/iGCSE Further Maths
- GCSE/iGCSE Physics
- GCSE/iGCSE Chemistry
- GCSE/iGCSE Statistics
- A Level Maths (all modules)
- A Level Further Maths (all modules)
- A Level Physics (all modules)

Although less experienced, I would also be very interested to tutor younger students (KS3 and above) in Maths and Physics, as well as tackling other education systems such as AP, MYP, and other international qualifications. I am a dedicated tutor and quick learner so can get familiar with new specifications and courses quickly.

## Tutoring Overview
At school I liked to self-teach a lot, so I worked out ways to use the information provided to come up with good explanations, clear diagrams, and other techniques for remembering the important information, and solving the problems that might come up in the exam. I have a strong and deep understanding of Maths and Physics and love to find new ways of explaining concepts and transferring this knowledge to students. I utilise a lot of this in my tutoring sessions, and hope to impart what I've learned over the course of when I took the IB.

Engineering and the IB have given me a very strong foundation in Maths and Physics, but overall I consider myself a generalist, and am interested in so many things beyond just Math, Physics and Engineering. I find this to be a strength as a tutor, because I know that lots of people aren't big fans of Maths or Physics or just have wider interests in general, and I really enjoy helping students gain a passion in maths and physics, and to begin to enjoy finding ways to apply these concepts to real life scenarios in areas that go beyond just technical stuff.

My passion lies in using Maths and Physics creatively and exploring non-traditional mathematical topics. I am committed to helping students excel in the GCSE, MYP, IB, and Oxbridge applications.

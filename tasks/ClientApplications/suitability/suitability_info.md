## Other courses
- Despite not taking these courses myself...

## Mathematics
- Recently graduated from Oxford with a degree in Engineering, so I have a strong background in Mathematics, and teaching approaches for Mathematics.
- My degree in Engineering means I am familiar with using Mathematics in a more practical and applied context.
- Before University I took the IB, scored 44 overall with a 7 in Higher Level Mathematics, and 19/20 in the IA.
- I was the only student at my school to get a 7 in HL Mathematics.
### FOR HL STUDENTS / STUDENTS WHO LIKE, ARE INTERESTED IN, AND PLAN TO USE MATHS IN THEIR FUTURE LIFE/CAREER
- My experience at uni and in the IB, and my deep knowledge of the subject means I can go into detail to help students gain a deep understanding of the subject, and can extend their knowledge and follow their interests if they want to.
- I have been in their position before and know what it takes to get the top marks (7s) in Maths. I was predicted 4s in the first year of IB, and got a 7 in the end.
### FOR SL STUDENTS / STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT LIKE, ARE NOT INTERESTED IN, OR DO NOT PLAN TO USE MATHS IN THEIR FUTURE LIFE/CAREER

## Physics
- Completed IB HL Physics at school and scored 7s in all exams and the IA.
- My Engineering degree included a lot of Physics, so I have a deep understanding of the subject.
### FOR HL STUDENTS / STUDENTS WHO LIKE, ARE INTERESTED IN, AND PLAN TO USE PHYSICS IN THEIR FUTURE LIFE/CAREER
### FOR SL STUDENTS / STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT LIKE, ARE NOT INTERESTED IN, OR DO NOT PLAN TO USE PHYSICS IN THEIR FUTURE LIFE/CAREER

## Physics IA

## Maths IA

## Computer Science
- I have nearly 5 years of programming experience. 
- My Engineering degree was specialised in Information and Software Engineering, so I did lots of programming and became comfortable with computer science concepts through my degree, including algorithms, data structures, software design, representation of data, computer hardware, etc.
- I have self studied the IB and iGCSE computer science courses to familiarise myself with the content, teaching approaches, and assessments (exam and IAs) to get me familiar with the courses and allow me to teach them.
- Proramming is one of my main pasttimes when I am not tutoring - I am confident in Javacript and Python, and also know some C++.
- I have built a variety of projects, including the system I use to manage my tutoring, an automatic darts scoring system and game using cameras to detect dart positions, a full stack desktop application for analysing music and creating visualisations of the data, etc.
- I took the iGCSE ICT course which was the precursor to the current iGCSE Computer Science course.

## Chemistry

## Oxford/Cambridge Engineering Applications
- Unique experience compared to other tutors in that I applied to Cambridge (2018) and Oxford (2019) which most people don't do, so I have done the process twice.
- I got into Oxford for Engineering, and although I didn't get into Cambridge, I was invited for interview and shortlisted for a place. I learned what to do and what not to do, from this experience.
- Very familiar with the Engineering Admissions process, how to succeed in it and what they are looking for.
- I have had close relationships with Engineering tutors while at Oxford so I know exactly what they are looking for in prospective applicants. 
- Can answer general questions about what it is like to study Engineering at Oxbridge, based on my own experiences.
- Can provide (and have provided) real-life scenarios, simulations, and practice interviews from my own interviews at Cambridge and Oxford.
- 3 years of tutoring experience, including supporting over 10 students globally (not just in the UK) with Oxbridge Engineering applications.
- I have delivered over 20 practice interviews and feedback sessions and have developed a sound structure and approach for Oxbridge Engineering interview preparation.
- My students have a 66% Engineering offer rate at Cambridge and Oxford, 3x the average (20%).

## Oxford/Cambridge Applications (Other Quantitative STEM Subjects)
- Unique experience compared to other tutors in that I applied to Cambridge (2018) and Oxford (2019) which most people don't do, so I have done the process twice.
- I got into Oxford, and although I didn't get into Cambridge, I was invited for interview and shortlisted for a place. I learned what to do and what not to do, from this experience.
- Even though I studied Engineering, subjects such as Maths, Physics, etc. are very similar in their process and are often looking for the same skills, so the skills I have learned are transferable.
- Very familiar with the Admissions process, how to succeed in it and what they are looking for.
- Can answer general questions about what it is like to study at Oxbridge, and live in Oxford (including offering advice on college selection, etc.)
- Can provide real-life scenarios, simulations, and practice interviews from my own interviews at Cambridge and Oxford.
- 3 years of tutoring experience, including supporting over 10 students globally (not just in the UK) with Oxbridge applications.
- I have delivered over 20 practice interviews and feedback sessions.
- My students have a 66% offer rate at Cambridge and Oxford, 3x the average (20%).

## Imperial College (IC) Application Support
- Despite going to Oxford, during my university applications I applied to Imperial College London twice (2018 and 2019), and was invited for interview both times.
- I recieved an offer both times, for EIE (Electronic and Information Engineering).
- Based on my application I was offered a scholarship.
- I have 3 years of experience tutoring, and lots of experience working alongside students to prepare for Maths/Physics based admissions tests. My past experience includes 5+ ESAT students. 
- I have helped a number of students get into Imperial College London for a variety of Engineering courses.

## ESAT and PAT
- Previous ESAT students have said that I prepared them really well for the test and that their experience of the ESAT was very aligned with what we worked on and practiced.
- The ESAT is new and I have spoken with past students who just took it in October 2024, so I am already familiar with the format, content and quirks of the test.
- I have 3 years of experience tutoring, and lots of experience working alongside students to prepare for Maths/Physics based admissions tests. My past experience includes 5+ ESAT students and 3+ PAT students. 
- Via my experience, I have developed a sound structure and approach for ESAT and PAT tutoring, which breaks down the test into key skills, and works on each based on priority and the student's needs.
- I took the ENGAA (the test on which the ESAT is based) in 2018 and was invited for interview after.
- I took the PAT when applying for Oxford in 2019 and got an offer.
- Other relevant admissions experience in the "Oxford/Cambridge Engineering Applications" and "Oxford/Cambridge Applications (Other Quantitative STEM Subjects)" sections.

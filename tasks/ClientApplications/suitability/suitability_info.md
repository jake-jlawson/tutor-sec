# SUITABILITY INFO

## Mathematics
- Recently graduated from Oxford with a degree in Engineering, so I have a strong background in Mathematics, and teaching approaches for Mathematics.
- My degree in Engineering means I am familiar with using Mathematics in a more practical and applied context.
- Before University I took the IB, scored 44 overall with a 7 in Higher Level Mathematics, and 19/20 in the IA.
- I was the only student at my school to get a 7 in HL Mathematics.
### FOR HL STUDENTS / STUDENTS WHO LIKE, ARE INTERESTED IN, AND PLAN TO USE MATHS IN THEIR FUTURE LIFE/CAREER
- My experience at uni and in the IB, and my deep knowledge of the subject means I can go into detail to help students gain a deep understanding of the subject, and can extend their knowledge and follow their interests if they want to.
- I have been in their position before and know what it takes to get the top marks (7s) in Maths. I was predicted 4s in the first year of IB, and got a 7 in the end.
### FOR SL STUDENTS / STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT LIKE, ARE NOT INTERESTED IN, OR DO NOT PLAN TO USE MATHS IN THEIR FUTURE LIFE/CAREER

## Physics

## Oxford/Cambridge Engineering Applications
- Unique experience compared to other tutors in that I applied to Cambridge (2018) and Oxford (2019) which most people don't do, so I have done the process twice.
- I got into Oxford for Engineering, and although I didn't get into Cambridge, I was invited for interview and shortlisted for a place. I learned what to do and what not to do, from this experience.
- Very familiar with the Engineering Admissions process, how to succeed in it and what they are looking for.
- I have had close relationships with Engineering tutors while at Oxford so I know exactly what they are looking for in prospective applicants. 
- Can answer general questions about what it is like to study Engineering at Oxbridge, based on my own experiences.
- Can provide real-life scenarios, simulations, and practice interviews from my own interviews at Cambridge and Oxford.
- 3 years of tutoring experience, including supporting over 10 students globally (not just in the UK) with Oxbridge Engineering applications.
- I have delivered over 20 practice interviews and feedback sessions.
- My students have a 66% Engineeringoffer rate at Cambridge and Oxford, 3x the average (20%).

## Oxford/Cambridge Applications (Other Quantitative STEM Subjects)
- Unique experience compared to other tutors in that I applied to Cambridge (2018) and Oxford (2019) which most people don't do, so I have done the process twice.
- I got into Oxford, and although I didn't get into Cambridge, I was invited for interview and shortlisted for a place. I learned what to do and what not to do, from this experience.
- Even though I studied Engineering, subjects such as Maths, Physics, etc. are very similar in their process and are often looking for the same skills, so the skills I have learned are transferable.
- Very familiar with the Admissions process, how to succeed in it and what they are looking for.
- Can answer general questions about what it is like to study at Oxbridge, and live in Oxford (including offering advice on college selection, etc.)
- Can provide real-life scenarios, simulations, and practice interviews from my own interviews at Cambridge and Oxford.
- 3 years of tutoring experience, including supporting over 10 students globally (not just in the UK) with Oxbridge applications.
- I have delivered over 20 practice interviews and feedback sessions.
- My students have a 66% offer rate at Cambridge and Oxford, 3x the average (20%).

## ESAT and PAT
- Previous ESAT students have said that I prepared them really well for the test and that their experience of the ESAT was very aligned with what we worked on and practiced.
- The ESAT is new and I have spoken with past students who just took it in October 2024, so I am already familiar with the format, content and quirks of the test.
- I have 3 years of experience tutoring, and lots of experience working alongside students to prepare for Maths/Physics based admissions tests. My past experience includes 5+ ESAT students and 3+ PAT students. 
- Via my experience, I have developed a sound structure and approach for ESAT and PAT tutoring, which breaks down the test into key skills, and works on each based on priority and the student's needs.
- I took the ENGAA (the test on which the ESAT is based) in 2018 and was invited for interview after.
- I took the PAT when applying for Oxford in 2019 and got an offer.
- Other relevant admissions experience in the "Oxford/Cambridge Engineering Applications" and "Oxford/Cambridge Applications (Other Quantitative STEM Subjects)" sections.

### About Me:
I'm Jake, a recent MEng graduate from the University of Oxford. I have extensive experience teaching Maths and Physical Sciences at the IB level, achieving a score of 44 in 2018 with 7s in both subjects. My passion lies in using Maths and Physics creatively and exploring non-traditional mathematical topics. I am committed to helping students excel in the GCSE, MYP, IB, A Levels, and Oxbridge applications.

I completed the IB at the British International School of Houston in 2018, scoring 44 with 7s in all my HL and SL subjects. Growing up in multiple countries—such as the US, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Malaysia, and the UK—has given me a unique background. Though I have a British accent, passport, and parents, I sometimes call myself "Texan," which tends to confuse people.

At school, I enjoyed self-teaching and developed ways to create clear explanations and diagrams for memorizing key information and solving problems. I incorporate these techniques into my tutoring sessions and aim to share what I’ve learned from my own IB journey.

During my studies at Oxford, I specialized in Information, Software, and Control, focusing on areas such as systems control, coding, data science, machine learning, probability, and statistics. *(Check out this video that describes some of what I do: [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA)).* This is my favorite engineering field as it has wide-ranging applications and allows for innovative data and software solutions.

I also have a deep interest in music—playing piano and guitar and even composing music in my younger years. For my 4th-year project, I built software to analyze music and compare song similarities. While Maths and Physics are my academic strengths, I consider myself a generalist with interests that go beyond technical subjects. I find this beneficial in tutoring, as it helps me relate to students who may have a wider range of interests and not a natural affinity for Maths or Physics.

I have experience working on Maths and Physics projects for both my degree and IB, including Internal Assessments (IAs). These projects allowed me to explore my interests within academic contexts, and I enjoy helping students do the same with their IAs to achieve high marks.

### Tutoring Style:
My approach blends student-driven and tutor-driven learning. I plan lessons tailored to the student's interests and needs, encouraging them to guide the lesson direction or suggest topics to focus on anytime.

In the first session, I get to know the student, assess their areas of struggle (content understanding, application, exam skills, problem-solving, etc.), and develop a plan together. I offer various teaching structures, from a course-based learning approach (methodical, filling gaps) to a skills-based approach (focused on practice problems and exam prep). Students can provide feedback anytime and request to adjust the lesson direction as needed.

My tutoring style draws inspiration from Oxford tutorials, encouraging students to explore topics independently, engage with questions, and contribute their ideas while I support, demonstrate, and guide them. Over time, I have developed systems to track student progress, session plans, and areas needing additional focus.

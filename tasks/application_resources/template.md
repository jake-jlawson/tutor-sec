## Example 1: Cambridge Interview Prep (Engineering)

**[Paragraph 1: Introductory message]**  
I would be very happy to support this student. [Short introduction to myself as a person] I have recently graduated from Oxford with a degree in Engineering and have 3 years of tutoring experience, including with many Oxford and Cambridge Engineering applications.

**[Paragraph 2: Experience, qualifications and suitability for the job]**  
[Relate to the student] I have been in the student’s position myself. [Experience and Qualifications that make me good for the job] I have a unique experience compared to other tutors in that I applied to both Cambridge (2018) and Oxford (2019) for Engineering, so I have done the whole process, including interviews, twice, and can provide lots of advice, tuition, support and practice based on my own experiences and my experiences successfully supporting other students. I have nearly 3 years of experience tutoring university admissions, and in the last application cycle, [a powerful statistic] 66% of my students received an Engineering offer from Oxford/Cambridge (compared to the average acceptance rate of 20%).

**[Paragraph 3: Tutoring style and outline of sessions]**  
[Tutoring style] My lessons are very interactive and student-focused, and I take lots of inspiration from the Oxford tutorial system, in that I get students involved, thinking independently, and ask lots of questions to encourage students to think, and help them through exercises rather than just telling them the answer - exactly the type of approach that will be used on applicants during interviews. I always get to know the student first and then together we develop a plan based on their current preparation and progress, and what they need to work on most to boost performance in their interview. [Specific outline of my support for the job at hand] My interview preparation mostly consists of teaching and practicing the core interview skills, and then putting this to the test with numerous practice interviews and feedback sessions.

**[Paragraph 4: Explaining what it takes to do well in the thing they are seeking tutoring for, and discuss specifically how I can help with that]**  
[Summary of what it takes to succeed to show I am knowledgeable] Being successful in a Cambridge Engineering interview is all about having a very strong knowledge and grasp of fundamental maths and physics, and then being able to apply that to potentially unfamiliar situations, to reach conclusions. Being able and comfortable to talk through and communicate your thoughts, as well as ask for, receive and use the help the interviewers give you is also a very important skill. [How I will directly help with this] I can help with all of this, and we will get you up to speed with all the skills you need, work on them, and practice them to get you as ready as you can be for the interviews!


## Example 2: ESAT Admissions Test Support for Cambridge and Imperial

**[Paragraph 1: Introductory message]**  
I’d be very happy to support this student with the ESAT and anything further related to their Engineering university applications (Cambridge and Imperial). [Short introduction to myself as a person] I have just graduated with an Engineering degree, specializing in Information, Control and Software Engineering, from Oxford.

**[Paragraph 2: Experience, qualifications and suitability for the job]**  
[Experience and Qualifications that make me good for the job] I have unique experience compared to other tutors since I applied to both Cambridge (2018) and Oxford (2019) so I have extensive experience of both processes having done the whole process twice, and have taken the ENGAA (the test which the ESAT is based on) myself. I also applied to Imperial both years for EIE so am experienced with their admissions process and what they are looking for in their candidates. I have nearly 3 years of tutoring experience supporting students with university admissions, and in the last application cycle, [a powerful statistic] 66% of my students received an Engineering offer from Oxford/Cambridge (3x the average acceptance rate of 20%).

**[Paragraph 3: Tutoring style and outline of sessions]**  
[Outline of exactly how I can help] I am able to support with all aspects of the application process, including the admissions tests (ESAT) to start, and personal statements, interview preparation and practice interviews, as well as being able to answer general questions and queries about studying Engineering and life at an Oxbridge university. [Tutoring style] My lessons are very interactive and student-focused. I use an online whiteboard and my lessons are inspired by the Oxford tutorial system, in that I get students involved, thinking for themselves, and working through questions with my support. [Personalizing the lessons to the student’s needs] I get to know the student and then together we develop a plan of how best to support them to perform as well as possible in their applications.

**[Paragraph 4: Explaining what it takes to do well in the thing they are seeking tutoring for, and discuss specifically how I can help with that]**  
[Summary of what it takes to succeed to show I am knowledgeable] The ESAT is all about having a strong knowledge of the basics of A Level Maths and Physics, and then being able to apply that to problems, quickly, effectively and under timed pressure. Exam strategy and technique is also very important for getting the top marks. [How I will directly help with this] I like the focus on all these aspects in order from highest priority to lowest priority, focusing first on boosting the student’s core knowledge, then on effective problem solving, and finally working on the speed at which they can complete questions.


## Example 3: IB Mathematics AI HL

**[Paragraph 1: Introductory message]**  
Hi, I’m Jake and I would be very happy to support you over the summer with Maths AI HL. [Short introduction to myself as a person] I’ve just graduated from Oxford with a degree in Engineering so I have a strong background in Mathematics as well as how it applies to real world applications.

**[Paragraph 2: Experience, qualifications and suitability for the job]**  
[Relate to the student] Before University I did the IB myself in Houston, Texas, scoring 44 with a 7 in HL Maths so I have been in your position. [Experience and Qualifications that make me good for the job] Since then I have been tutoring students in Maths and Physics for the past 3 years, so I have built up lots of experience teaching the IB Maths courses and helping students succeed in them. I have helped [a powerful statistic] over 10 students with IB Mathematics AI HL, and one of my biggest passions is helping students truly gain a real understanding and appreciation for mathematics, how it applies everywhere, and how useful it is for describing the world.

**[Paragraph 3: Tutoring style and outline of sessions]**  
[Tutoring style] In my lessons I listen to students as much as possible, and my lessons are a mix of student-guided and tutor-guided learning. [Personalizing the lessons to the student’s needs] I take the first 20 minutes of the first lesson to understand the student’s specific struggles in terms of content, understanding, exam skills, problem solving, and any other struggles they have, and we then use this to design a plan together to get them where they want to be. My lessons are very much inspired by the Oxford tutorial system, in that I get students engaged with topics and encourage them to think and understand material deeply by asking them questions and supporting them as they apply their knowledge to practice questions. I conduct lessons using an online whiteboard to provide visual explanations and can also provide additional support with things such as general IB advice, IAs, and providing practice questions, worksheets and other resources for the student to solidify their understanding.

**[Paragraph 4: Explaining what it takes to do well in the thing they are seeking tutoring for, and discuss specifically how I can help with that]**  
[Summary of what it takes to succeed to show I am knowledgeable] I find in AI it is most important to be comfortable using your calculator, as well as having a deep understanding of the mathematical concepts and how they apply to real life situations. Problem solving an exam technique is also key to doing well in AI HL. [How I will directly help with this] In all of these areas, I have lots of experience, tips, tricks, knowledge and advice both from my time in the IB and my time at University, that I hope to be able to pass on to you!

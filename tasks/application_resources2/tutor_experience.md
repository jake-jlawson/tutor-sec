## Tutoring Experience
I have first-hand experience with many of the things students might need support with. I have the unique experience of having applied to Oxbridge twice in a row for Engineering (Cambridge in 2018 and Oxford in 2019), so I have done the whole process (admissions tests, personal statements, interviews, etc.) twice. I also applied to Imperial twice along with Oxbridge so I know what that process is like and what they are looking for. I have had numerous conversations directly with Oxford Engineering tutors and Admissions Officers while I have been at Oxford. I have taken both the ENGAA (pre-cursor to the ESAT) and PAT. In terms of IB, I got 7s in HL Mathematics and Physics, with 7s in both Maths and Physics IAs. I also took iGCSEs in 2016 achieving 11 A*s, and self studied much of the Maths and Physics A level courses to prepare myself for University.Through my school and University work I have vast experience with Maths and Physics-based projects, so can offer support with all aspects of coursework, including idea generation, data collection, experiment design, idea development, mathematical modelling, structuring, research and writing up. 

I have been tutoring students in Maths and Physics for the past 3 years, delivering over 400 hours of lessons to over 50 different students, so I have built up lots of experience teaching these courses and helping students succeed in them. One of my biggest passions is helping students truly gain a real understanding and appreciation for mathematics, how it applies everywhere, and how useful it is for describing the world. Engineering and the IB have given me a very strong foundation in Maths and Physics, but overall I consider myself a generalist, and am interested in so many things beyond just Maths, Physics and Engineering. I find this to be a strength as a tutor, because I know that lots of people aren't big fans of Maths or Physics or just have wider interests in general, and I really enjoy helping students gain a passion in maths and physics, and to begin to enjoy finding ways to apply these concepts to real life scenarios in areas that go beyond just technical stuff.

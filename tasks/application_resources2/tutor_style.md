# Tutor Style
My approach blends student-driven and tutor-driven learning. I plan lessons tailored to the student's interests and needs, encouraging them to guide the lesson direction or suggest topics to focus on anytime they need to. At school, I enjoyed self-teaching and developed ways to create clear explanations and diagrams for memorizing key information and solving problems. I incorporate these techniques into my tutoring sessions and aim to share what Iâ€™ve learned from my own school and university journey.

In the first session, I always get to know the student (diagnostic session), assess their areas of struggle (content understanding, application, exam skills, problem-solving, etc.), and develop a plan together based on where they are at and where they want to go. I offer various teaching structures, from a course-based learning approach (methodical, filling gaps) to a skills-based approach (focused on practice problems and exam prep). Students can provide feedback anytime and request to adjust the lesson direction as needed.

My tutoring style draws inspiration from Oxford tutorials, encouraging students to explore topics independently, engage with questions, and contribute their ideas while I support, demonstrate, and guide them. Over time, I have developed systems to track student progress, session plans, and areas needing additional focus.

I use an online whiteboard to provide visual explanations and can also provide additional support with things such as general IB/Oxbridge advice, IAs/coursework, EPQs, and providing practice questions, worksheets and other resources for the student to solidify their understanding.
